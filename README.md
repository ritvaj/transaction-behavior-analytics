<h1 align="center">Transaction Behavior Analytics & Fraud Signal Modeling</h1>

A Python-based fraud analytics project analyzing **200,000 simulated financial transactions** to engineer behavioral risk features, surface anomaly patterns, and evaluate threshold-based fraud detection strategies.  
Instead of relying solely on ML models, this project explores a **cost-efficient, interpretable rule-based fraud scoring system** inspired by real fintech risk operations.

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

Most fraud-detection research focuses on machine learning models.  
But real-world fintech teams rely heavily on **behavioral rules, dynamic thresholds, and interpretable signals** — because they are fast, cheap, transparent, and easy to update when fraudsters adapt.

This project frames the problem like a business analyst at a fintech company:

> **“How far can we push fraud detection using pure analytics, feature engineering, and interpretable scoring — before using ML?”**

It also serves as an end-to-end application of Python, NumPy, pandas, feature engineering, and exploratory visual analytics on a large transaction dataset.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand transaction behavior at scale and map patterns linked to fraud signals.  
- Engineer interpretable features (mismatch signals, velocity rules, mule behaviors, balance anomalies).  
- Build a **Fraud Signal Score** — a weighted, interpretable risk index.  
- Evaluate multiple thresholds using precision, recall, lift, and false-positive behavior.  
- Identify high-risk accounts and transaction patterns for further investigation.

## 📊 Visual Gallery (EDA)

Exploratory analysis of transaction behavior using engineered features:

1. **Log-Amount Distribution**  
2. **Fraud vs Non-Fraud Transaction Amount**  
3. **Origin Mismatch Rate by Type**  
4. **Destination Activity vs Mismatch Rate**  
5. **Either vs Both Mismatch**  
6. **Mule Score Density (Fraud vs Non-Fraud)**  
7. **Fraud Signal Score Distribution**  

A Precision–Recall Curve is shown later under model evaluation.

_All images are stored in `outputs/figures/`._

## 🧠 Feature Engineering Overview

Fraud is often behavioral — not statistical.  
This project focuses on engineering **interpretable, rule-based signals** across four categories:

### **1. Ledger Mismatch Signals**
- `origin_mismatch`  
- `dest_mismatch`  
- `either_mismatch`  
- `both_mismatch`  

### **2. Amount & Balance Anomalies**
- `log_amount`  
- `is_high_amount`  
- `balance_ratio`  
- `insufficient_funds`  
- `origin_balance_drain`  

### **3. Velocity Features**
- Origin velocity counts  
- Destination velocity counts  
- `dest_tx_count_step`  
- Destination bursts  

### **4. Mule Behavior Indicators**
- `is_pass_through`  
- `is_many_senders`  
- High-velocity destinations  
- First-time receiver indicator

## 🔍 Fraud Signal Score (Interpretable Risk Index)

A weighted sum of anomaly indicators:

fraud_signal_score =
2.5 * mule_score_high

2.5 * both_mismatch

2.0 * is_dest_velocity

1.0 * is_pass_through

1.0 * is_many_senders

1.0 * dest_burst

1.0 * is_new_dest



Why this approach?

- Fully explainable  
- No black-box ML  
- Easy to tune  
- Fast enough for real-time systems  

The output is a **single behavioral risk score** per transaction.

## 📈 Threshold Evaluation & A/B Testing

Tested thresholds: **3, 4, 5, 6**

For each threshold:

- Precision  
- Recall  
- False Positive Rate  
- Lift  
- Fraud rate among flagged transactions  
- TP / FP / FN / TN counts  

A **Precision–Recall Curve** visualizes the trade-off under class imbalance.

Tables are provided in:

## 🔑 Key Insights

- Mismatch + velocity features were the strongest behavioral discriminators.  
- Mule-behavior features separated fraud and non-fraud distributions cleanly.  
- First-time receivers showed disproportionately high anomaly rates.  
- Rule-based scoring delivered interpretable trade-offs suitable for real fintech risk teams.  
- Precision was limited by dataset imbalance, but behavioral clustering remained strong.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add a lightweight ML model to compare performance with rule-based scoring.  
- Incorporate temporal drift analysis and rolling-window velocity features.  
- Expose a real-time scoring API using FastAPI.  
- Automate threshold tuning with Bayesian optimization.  
- Scale analysis to the full 2M-row PaySim dataset.
