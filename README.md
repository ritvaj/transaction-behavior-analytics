<h1 align="center">Transaction Behavior Analytics & Fraud Signal Modeling</h1>

A behavioral transaction analysis project on 200,000 records, engineering interpretable risk signals, surfacing anomaly patterns, and evaluating threshold-based detection strategies.  
Built using Python (NumPy, pandas) to demonstrate how interpretable scoring systems can support cost-efficient, real-time fraud operations before deploying ML models.

## 💡 Why This Project?

Fintech payment systems face fast-evolving fraud patterns where attackers exploit behavior — velocity spikes, aggregation bursts, pass-through flows — rather than simple rule violations. Detecting these anomalies early, without relying entirely on costly or opaque ML systems, is a core operational challenge.

This project examines how far behavioral analytics, engineered features, and interpretable scoring can push fraud detection on their own — before introducing machine learning. It also raises a practical question every fraud-ops team faces: *how much risk coverage can be achieved with transparent, rule-based scoring before the added cost, latency, and governance burden of ML becomes justified?*

Alongside the business framing, the project serves as an end-to-end application of Python (NumPy, pandas), feature engineering, anomaly exploration, and threshold evaluation on a large-scale transaction dataset.

## 🧠 Feature Engineering Overview

Fraud is often behavioral — not statistical.  
This project focuses on engineering **interpretable, rule-based signals** across four categories:

### **1. Ledger Mismatch Signals**
- `origin_mismatch` — origin ledger mismatch (1/0)
- `dest_mismatch` — destination ledger mismatch (1/0)  
- `either_mismatch` — `origin_mismatch` OR `dest_mismatch`
- `both_mismatch` — both origin and dest mismatch (1/0)

### **2. Amount & Balance Anomalies**
- `log_amount` — `log(amount + 1)` (float)
- `is_high_amount` — thresholded high-amount flag (1/0)
- `balance_ratio` — post-tx balance / pre-tx balance (float)  
- `insufficient_funds` — flag if balance < amount (1/0) 
- `origin_drain_by_type` — cumulative drain metric for origin by transaction type. 

### **3. Velocity Features**
- `orig_tx_count_step` — count of recent outgoing tx from origin (int)
- `Dest_tx_count_step` — count of recent incoming tx to destination
- `dest_tx_count_last3` — count of recent incoming tx to destination in the last 3 consecutive steps

### **4. Mule Behavior Indicators**
- `is_pass_through` — destination immediately forwards funds (1/0)
- `is_many_senders` — destination receives from many distinct senders (1/0)  
- `is_dest_high_velocity` — destination has very high recent inbound velocity (1/0) 
- `is_high_amount` — thresholded high-amount flag (1/0)

## 🔍 Fraud Signal Score (Interpretable Risk Index)

Weighted, rule-based scoring system combining key anomaly features into a single interpretable risk measure.:

fraud_signal_score =

2.5 * mule_score_w_high

2.5 * both_mismatch

2.0 * is_dest_velocity

1.0 * is_pass_through

1.0 * is_many_senders

1.0 * dest_burst

1.0 * is_new_dest



Why this approach?

- Fully explainable  
- No black-box ML  
- Easy to tune  
- Fast enough for real-time systems  

The output is a **single behavioral risk score** per transaction.

---

## 📈 Threshold Evaluation & A/B Testing
To operationalize the Fraud Signal Score, we test fraud signal score thresholds 3, 4, 5, 6 to see how well each cutoff separates fraud from normal traffic.
Each threshold is compared on precision, recall, false-positive rate, lift, and TP/FP/FN/TN.

Tested thresholds: **3, 4, 5, 6**

For each threshold:

- Precision  
- Recall  
- False Positive Rate  
- Lift  
- Fraud rate among flagged transactions  
- TP / FP / FN / TN counts  

A **Precision–Recall Curve** visualizes the trade-off under class imbalance.

## 📊 Model Performance Visuals

The following visuals summarize how the engineered behavioral features translate into risk separation, scoring quality, and threshold performance.

### 🔄 Mismatch Rate vs Destination Activity

<p align="center">
  <img src="outputs/figures/04_Mismatch_Rate_vs_Destination_Activity_Level.png" width="650">
</p>

**Insight:**  
Destination mismatch rates increase sharply as receiver activity rises.  
Even single-inbound transactions show moderate anomaly levels, but when a destination collects **2–4 inbound payments within the same hour**, mismatch rates spike dramatically.

This pattern aligns with **mule account behavior**, where funds are aggregated rapidly from multiple unrelated sources.  
Although higher-activity buckets have smaller sample sizes, the overall upward trend is clear:  
**abnormal destination-side behavior is one of the strongest early fraud signals in the dataset.**

---

### 🕵️ Mule Score Density — Fraud vs Non-Fraud

<p align="center">
  <img src="outputs/figures/06_Mule_Score_Fraud_vs_Non_Fraud.png" width="650">
</p>

**Insight:**  
Fraudulent transactions consistently show **higher mule-scores**, while legitimate users cluster tightly near **zero**.  
The fraud density curve exhibits a **clear right-shift**, reflecting behaviors such as multiple inbound sends, rapid aggregation, and short-lived receiver accounts.  
High mule scores are extremely rare among normal users, making this a **highly reliable behavioral risk indicator**.

---

### 🔐 Fraud Signal Score Distribution — Fraud vs Non-Fraud

<p align="center">
  <img src="outputs/figures/07_FraudScore_fraud_vs_nonfraud.png" width="650">
</p>

**Insight:**  
Fraud transactions cluster between **1–3**, while non-fraud behavior is concentrated around **0–1**.  
Despite some overlap (expected in real systems), fraud shows a pronounced **right-shift** and heavier mid-score tail.  
This validates that the combined rule-based signals capture **meaningful anomaly structure** from behavioral patterns.

---

### 🎯 Precision–Recall Curve (Threshold Evaluation)

<p align="center">
  <img src="outputs/figures/precision_recall_curve.png" width="650">
</p>

**Insight:**  
With fraud occurring only **0.13%** of the time, baseline precision is extremely low — yet the Fraud Signal Score shows **clear ranking power**, producing a meaningful curve instead of noise.  
While absolute precision is modest (normal for synthetic imbalance), the model demonstrates **strong relative ordering**, enabling better queueing and investigation prioritization in real fraud operations.
